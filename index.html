    <p>Hello, my name is Marie Alayon, and I am a current junior at La Mirada High School, enrolled in CIS216 (HTML & CSS) at Cerritos College. I have experience coding both in HTML and Python in the past, as well as VEXCode5. Some facts about me is that I am in my school's marching band and engineering pathway. I'm a little intimidated by the online structure of this class, especially because school through COVID was horrible(!), but I love the flexibility and independence that this format offers. I know a lot of people say that there's not much you can do with HTML, but I hope through this class I am able to make some fun side projects!</p>
